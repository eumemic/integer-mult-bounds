# Gen5b weighted matching with second scalar descent

This package rebuilds compensated reuse after the producer's endpoint descent,
choosing donors by their actual final-frame ranks. It composes the resulting word
with all 1,720 PR299 kernel entries, PR300's second scalar descent, 440 early
restorations and seven terminal sinks.
The exact conditional finite bound is

**κ = 46942230864663 / 62500000000000000 = 0.000751075693834608.**

This is about **0.15688% above independently reproduced PR299**, whose bound is
0.000749899215319498, and **0.00249968% above our preceding weighted-matching
checkpoint** (`03acc26`). The improvement is a matching and composition result;
all inherited all-size hypotheses remain conditional. No global-optimality or
practical runtime claim is made.

## What changes

The exact post-descent donor graph contains 65,920 eligible edges. Rebuilding
matching there admits 1,728 reuse pairs instead of 1,726. Among maximum-cardinality
matchings, the donor-rank rule selects 878 rank-21 donors instead of 706. Higher
rank donors give a larger donor-only concave splice benefit for every fixed
exponent between zero and one. The proof is scoped to this fixed graph and
objective, not the whole construction; see [MATCHING-PROOF.md](MATCHING-PROOF.md).

All 904 scalar retimings and 220 target groups are rebound to the changed word.
Kernel entries are mapped through logical roles to the new indices and rechecked;
PR300's 89 post-kernel scalar retimings are bound by logical role, identical
scalar occurrence census and exact old-frame basis. Restorations and sinks are
freshly screened after this second descent. See
[SECOND-DESCENT-PROOF.md](SECOND-DESCENT-PROOF.md). The original kernel, restoration,
sink, bank-checking, prime, moment, outer, mathematical and finite checker cores
remain unchanged. Exact initial counts, the global namespace, residual census
and expected derived values are specialized to the new word, retaining assertions.

| Quantity | PR299 | Weighted matching |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Reuse pairs | 1726 | 1728 |
| Final independent dirty registers | 15427 | 15425 |
| Literal stock, 60 replicas | 1229750 | 1229735 |
| Kernel entries | 1720 | 1720 |
| Early restorations | 440 | 440 |
| Terminal sinks | 7 | 7 |

The final invoice charges 913 endpoint charts, the conservative normalizer 815,
and 905,876,840,400 selector calls. Both cleanup and dirty old-value return remain
paid. The second descent changes local paid calls from 93,539 to 93,604 while
preserving rank mass and all scalar ADD events. Its complete primitive coefficient
is 90,322,316,339,049,601, including the additional calls. The exact checks bind these costs to the actual emitted word and bank
assignments. The signed decoder is checked over the integers; only its F2
reduction is asserted to equal the identity target contract.

## Reproduce

Use Python 3.11 or later, SymPy 1.14.0 and a new output directory outside the
package. Each command is network-free after dependency installation.

```sh
python -m pip install -r research/gen5b-weighted-matching/requirements.txt
python -B research/gen5b-weighted-matching/verify.py \
  --output /tmp/gen5b-weighted-verification
python -B research/gen5b-weighted-matching/gen5bit/producer/regenerate.py \
  --work /tmp/gen5b-weighted-regeneration
```

`verify.py` freshly runs twelve stages: virtual, raw, bit, kernel, restoration,
sink, scalar, primes, banks, complex, mathematics and finite admission. It rejects
pin-recording mode, runs all retained negative controls, rejects missing stages,
checks that skipping the second descent is rejected by the unchanged restoration
input-word guard, and verifies the complete source manifest before and after execution. The result
is `verification.json` with detailed receipts beside it.

`regenerate.py` starts with the inherited module data and producers, rebuilds the
original word and endpoint descent, then executes the new weighted matching
producer. It cross-checks maximum cardinality using Hopcroft-Karp and checks all
local F2 and defining-integer-decoder columns. All five resulting bit files must
match the pinned submission, with gzip members compared after decompression.
Its matching receipt is `matching.json`. The dedicated workflow runs full
verification on Python 3.11 and 3.13, plus regeneration on Python 3.13.

The final virtual-word SHA-256 after decompression is
`9144bc371104df43abf65f8fcff7a0f195301118ccb4c37b02799799d9f2eec1`.
`SOURCE.json` records the exact PR299 commit and original-file differences;
`MANIFEST.json` hashes every packaged file. The original PR299 README and notice
are preserved as README-PR299.md and NOTICE-PR299.md. PR300's full notice is
preserved as NOTICE-PR300.md; SECOND-DESCENT-PROVENANCE.json pins its contribution. Other inherited discovery
scripts document upstream searches; the commands above reproduce and verify this
submitted construction.

The all-size compiler, common chart, restored rows, selectors, routing, prime
supply, precision/recovery, complex correctness and analytic interfaces remain
assumptions. Finite success does not certify the entire multiplication theorem.
