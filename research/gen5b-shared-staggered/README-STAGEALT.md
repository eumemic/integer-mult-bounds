# Concave-descent frame retiming and target-prefix compression on the gen5 five-stage completed banks

**κ = 372060348198521/(5·10^17) = 7.44120696397042e-4**, conditional, with the bit supplier binding: +1.34 × 10⁻⁶ (+0.180 %) over the gen5 package below (7.42785663120535e-4).

This package is DreamingOfClouds' `five-stage-gen5-banks` with two added stages after `parity_transform.py`: `descent_transform.py` (frozen `descent-selection.json`) and then `target_transform.py` (eumemic's PR268 exact F₂ target-prefix compression, unchanged apart from the stream count; frozen `target-selection.json`). In each of 220 squares of four targets, every rank-20 entrance helper is read by exactly two of the four, so the dependent target's frame-20 prefix response is the F₂ sum of its three square-mates'; its 1,100 frame-20 reads are omitted, it receives `t −= p_j` at the zero frame at the cut and `t += p_j` at the square's common nondegenerate 21-dimensional frame at the close (1,320 setup/restore additions; 575,052 weighted ADDs), so ZERO →(20)→(1)→ 21 becomes ZERO →(21)→ 21 (histogram delta {1: −221, 2: −8, 17: −1, 18: −7, 20: −212, 21: +220}). The target transform recomputes every literal prefix dependency from the actual word, rebuilds every MOVE, checks nesting, endpoints, COPY lifetimes, nondegenerate bases and both all-column replays with an omitted-setup control, and rebinds the raw ledger. The retiming stage: The gen5 word had no frame retiming; local descent on the concave paid-rank objective Σ r·ln(120/r) reassigns 904 ADD frames: each unborrowed source-pair mix runs at its rank-22 common delivery frame exactly as PR244 did for source527 (per pair the paid children of ranks 1, 1, 20, 22 become 21, 21, 2) plus 24 further internal gates; local paid histogram delta {1: −1760, 2: +880, 6: +24, 7: −48, 8: +24, 20: −880, 21: +1760, 22: −880}, so 880 local recursive calls disappear at unchanged rank mass 411,356. The transform rebuilds every MOVE from the retimed gate needs and independently checks the byte-identical scalar/COPY projection, nested chains, fixed source/dirty/target endpoints, unchanged COPY lifetimes, nondegenerate endpoint bases, both reflected annihilator ledgers, and the exact integer source span of every non-target operand inside its new frame; `raw_ledger.rebind_descent` recounts the five-stage profile (474,744 calls after the retiming, 473,599 after the squares; rank mass 2,746,720) and `bank_check`/`verify.py` require the new counts and κ. `prime_check` retains the determinant obligation for producer frames the retiming removes (PR244's rule). Banks, entrances, charts, the scalar word and all endpoints are unchanged.

# gen5 bit word in the five-stage completed banks

A conditional finite construction with **κ = 148557132624107/(2·10¹⁷) ≈ 7.42785663120535 × 10⁻⁴**.

This package is #276's gen4 package with one change: a new bit word, **gen5**. gen5 keeps gen4's arc-aware
per-cube local circuit and replaces its two module circuits. Both new modules were annealed against the
exact one-instance compile cost.

| Module | gen4 | gen5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pair + copied centre | 448 additions, debt 184 | 463 additions, 299 arcs, debt 164 |
| all-but-one | 34 additions, 22 arcs, debt 12 | 32 additions, 21 arcs, debt 11 |

Every later stage is unchanged: PR234's five-stage layout, the stage-private width-120 completed banks and
the source527 verification chain (eumemic). The bit supplier still binds, 0.55% below the retained complex
supplier.

Run with Python 3.11+ and assertions enabled:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -B verify.py --output /tmp/gen5-five-stage-verification
```

The output directory must be new and outside this immutable package. Verification takes about five
minutes, uses no network and runs no producer. It performs these checks:

- the PR168-v4 checker on the virtual word, with its five mutation controls;
- PR200's physical-word proof, exactly as PR200 ran it: frames, handoffs, the physical row and all-column
  replays, with 4 adverse controls;
- the retained source527 scalar program on all 19,406 formal F₂ columns, both integer decoder signs and
  11 corruptions;
- the physical event emitter, parity fusion and five-stage global lowering;
- exact h=24/m=120 geometry, including one actual entrance basis of each rank 17, 18, 20 and 21;
- exact determinants for 25,802 bases;
- 411 bank charts and all 4,765,800 bank assignments;
- the retained complex supplier, both rational moment engines, the 47 outer inequalities and the finite
  bill.

`gen5bit/producer/regenerate.py` rebuilds the five pinned bit-word files from the generator and the two
physical-layer producers, and checks them byte for byte. This is provenance only, not part of the proof.

The result is conditional on the retained all-size compiler, common weighted chart, restored rows,
selectors, tape routing, prime supply, precision/recovery, complex symbolic correctness and analytic
reduction. The included finite checks do not replace those hypotheses. See `PROOF.md` for the
verification chain, `BANK-PROOF.md` for the banks, `gen5bit/README.md` for the bit word and `NOTICE.md`
